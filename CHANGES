SRM (0.3.0-1)

  # Additions

  * SRMBuffer now supports external OpenGL ES 2.0 textures.
  * Introduce srmBufferGetTextureTarget() for retrieving the OpenGL texture target of an SRMBuffer.

  # Bug Fixes

  * Disabled ITSELF rendering mode on Nouveau in multi-GPU setups to prevent crashes in drivers that do not support multitreading.
  * Fixed tearing of the first rendered frame when triple buffering is enabled.

SRM (0.2.0-1)

  # Additions

  * Introduce srmCoreSuspend() and srmCoreResume() functions to manage libseat session switching.
  * Add srmConnectorGetRendererDevice() function to simplify the retrieval of SRMBuffer OpenGL texture IDs, 
    reducing the need for repetitive calls to srmDeviceGetRendererDevice(srmConnectorGetDevice(connector)).

  # Internal Changes

  * Transition from using poll to epoll for handling udev monitor events.

  # Bug Fixes

  * Udev hotplugging events are now queued while SRM is suspended and emitted upon restoration. 
    This resolves the issue where connectors failed to initialize when connected while the session was suspended.
  * Fixed the bug where connectors rendering threads did not block when suspended.
